A palatial structure frames the scene, and Edward and Harold touch index fingers. Edward is royally attired, with a fleur-de-lys crown and matching scepter, and has his customary white hair and beard. The two other men have moustaches, as do most of the Anglo-Saxons in the early parts of the Tapestry (see&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#336600\"><b>Glossary: Hairstyles</b></font></a>).

Additionally, as&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Douglas</b></font></a>(1964, 177-179) notes, William\u2019s Breton campaign took place in 1064 (see&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#336600\"><b>Glossary: William\u2019s Breton Campaign</b></font></a>).<br></p><p style=\"caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -webkit-standard; letter-spacing: normal;\">The location and purpose of this scene are less assuredly determined.&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Grape</b></font></a>(1994, 91) and&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Brown</b></font></a>(1965, 80) locate the action at&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#336600\"><b>Westminster</b></font></a>, while&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Wilson</b></font></a>(1985, 174) believes it more likely that Edward here resides at&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#336600\"><b>Winchester</b></font></a>.<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -webkit-standard; letter-spacing: normal;\">However, some scholars have observed structural similarities between this scene and Edward\u2019s death scene at Westminster in&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000080\"><b>panel</b></font></a>70 that would locate this scene at Westminster.&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Gibbs-Smith</b></font></a>(1957, 163) argues that the cushion of Edward\u2019s throne is of the same pattern as that of Edward\u2019s death-bed, though this is probably only an ornamental convention. More convincingly,&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Holmes</b></font></a>(1959, 180) argues in detail that this building and the building in&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000080\"><b>panel</b></font></a>70 are the same structure from different perspectives. It is generally agreed that King Edward here gives some sort of instruction to his vassal. For a full treatment of the presumed nature of Edward\u2019s orders and the nature of Harold\u2019s subsequent mission, see&nbsp;<b><font color=\"#336600\"><a>Glossary: Harold\u2019s Mission</a></font></b>.</p><p style=\"caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -webkit-standard; letter-spacing: normal;\"><u>Details:</u><br>Much has been written on the architectural details of the palace.&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Wilson</b></font></a>(1985, 216) notes that most representations of English palaces indicate \"that the main accommodation consisted of a large hall with open timber roof, perhaps with a curved ridge-pole and roof lights and an opening to allow smoke to escape through a central turret\" and that \"angle turrets are normally represented on the exterior and an elaborate facade with central doorway is suggested in the first scene.\"&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Holmes</b></font></a>(1959, 180) postulates that the structure is most likely wooden, and that the \"checkerboard arrangement of design [on the left tower] can represent square pieces of hide nailed onto the siding as protection against fire and missiles.\"&nbsp;<b><a><font color=\"#000000\">Gem</font></a></b>(1981, 60), however, notes the decorative use of glazed tiles on vertical surfaces in late tenth- and early eleventh-century Anglo-Saxon buildings, and views the \"decorative lozenge pattern\" seen here and in&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000080\"><b>panel</b></font></a>28 as congruent with the Tapestry\u2019s likely&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#6666FF\"><b>English origin</b></font></a>. One such remarkable and large example of an eleventh-century glazed lozenge patterned wall survives at Westminster, though it is not in public view. In contrast,&nbsp;<b><a><font color=\"#000000\">Lewis</font></a></b>(1999, 44) considers the shape of the palace and of Harold\u2019s manor in&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000080\"><b>panel</b></font></a>5 as anachronistically Norman, and as evidence of the Norman colonizing strategy that \"situates the viewer within an inevitable future post-Conquest Norman landscape.\" As&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Lampl</b></font></a>(1961, 11) has observed, this scene exemplifies the medieval artistic convention of opening a front view to expose an interior scene (<i>cf.</i><a><font color=\"#000080\"><b>panel</b></font></a>5 and&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#006633\"><b>Museum: Bosham Village Church</b></font></a>. Lampl also compares part of the palace to a traditional cathedral, and posits that the left-hand structure has the appearance of a \"nave, two side aisles, two stair towers, central crossing tower, with the facade cut away to show the interior.\"&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Harfield</b></font></a>(1996, 164) compares the secondary door through which Harold leaves to the open door in&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000080\"><b>panel</b></font></a>119.&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Mann</b></font></a>(1974, 61) argues, improbably, that this scene is directly influenced by MS Junius 11 and that the building itself is a conflation of structures found in two scenes from this manuscript \"Rebel angels pointing to a citadel\" and \"Cain in the city of Enoch.\" However, the structural typology of the scene is quite common in both Continental and Insular sources; for parallel examples, see British Lib. Cotton MS Claudius Biv, f. 22r, and the Spanish Roda Bible (MS Lat. 6 Bib. Nationale), f. 97v.&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Chambers</b></font></a>(1932, 27) finds the structure to echo forms of the letter H, but does not elaborate on the symbolic significance.<br></p><p style=\"caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -webkit-standard; letter-spacing: normal;\">The representation of Harold and Edward provides several typological clues to their relationship. The scene is that of a formal audience; Edward is iconographically represented as ruler and as&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Wilson</b></font></a>(1985, 174) notes, the depiction of the king here echoes his royal seal (see&nbsp;<b><font color=\"#006633\"><a>Museum: King Edward\u2019s Seal</a></font></b>).&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Wormald</b></font></a>(1957, 31) also stresses that Edward here parallels other iconographic representations of kings. Edward sits on a beast-backed, claw-footed throne common in both Continental and Insular illuminations of the period;&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Lethieullier</b></font></a>(1767, 4) remarks that the arms of Edward\u2019s throne ends in dog heads.&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Lewis</b></font></a>(1999, 33-34) reads Harold\u2019s dwarfed representation as evidence of Harold\u2019s reinscription into Norman feudal relations of power; she also (54) argues that this scene also functions as a \"freeze-frame\" -- an arresting of action which generates narrative tension.&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Fowke</b></font></a>(1898, 26),&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Brooks</b></font></a>(1978, 11), and&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Cowdrey</b></font></a>(1997, 102) all comment on the fact that the earl and the king touch index fingers. Fowke views the action \"as if to secure a binding promise or oath\" and sees this as evidence that Edward here tells Harold to travel to Normandy to confirm Edward\u2019s promise to William. Brooks also argues that the touching of index figures here is proof \"that the artist intended Edward to be understood as giving instructions to Harold, for in late Saxon pictorial narrative this arrangement of hands is used to show a master instructing his servant\" and notes a parallel image in MS Claudius Biv, f. 65r (see&nbsp;<b><font color=\"#006633\"><a>Museum: Touching Fingers</a></font></b>). However, Brooks also contends that the Tapestry illustrates \"double instructions\" here and that the Normans would see Edward telling Harold to affirm his kingship while Anglo-Saxons would see Harold leaving for Normandy against the king\u2019s will.</p><p style=\"caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -webkit-standard; letter-spacing: normal;\"><u>Borders:</u><br><a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>McNulty</b></font></a>(1989, 85) observes that the lions in the borders are traditionally associated with royalty. It is also notable that these figures reinforce the formal aspect of Harold\u2019s audience with Edward.&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Wilson</b></font></a>(1985, 174) believes that the vegetal ornament in the top left border reflects aspects of a Scandinavian Ringerike style. For a discussion of the left-hand border, see Restorations, below.</p><p style=\"caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -webkit-standard; letter-spacing: normal;\"><u>Inscriptions:</u></p><p style=\"caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -webkit-standard; letter-spacing: normal;\"><a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Short</b></font></a>(2001, 271) notes the alternation of Old English forms of Edward\u2019s name here and in&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000080\"><b>panel</b></font></a>64 with the \"EA\" dipthong form in&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000080\"><b>panel</b></font></a>67 and&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000080\"><b>panel</b></font></a>70. Further, Short wonders if the lack of the Old English dipthong in the first use of the name may be significant, though this form may be a restoration (see below).</p><p style=\"caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -webkit-standard; letter-spacing: normal;\"><u>Restorations:</u><br>Much of this opening scene has been restored, and large patches are clearly discernible. The 1729 engravings of Montfaucon (<b><a><font color=\"#006633\">Facsimile: Montfaucon</font></a></b>, panel 1) do not show any of the inscription EDWARD.&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Dawson</b></font></a>(1907, 256) comments that early restorers (<i>ca.</i>1730) inserted all of EDWARD. Montfaucon\u2019s engravings do not show moustaches on Edward\u2019s audience, and Dawson notes that these were added in the restorations of 1842 (288).&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Wilson</b></font></a>(1985, 174) views most of this restoration as \"overdone\" and \"clumsy\" and observes that most of the left-hand border, as well as parts of the palace-hall\u2019s facade, has been redone. Additionally, the pair of lions in the lower-left border are almost completely new.&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Bertrand</b></font></a>(1966, 205-206), followed by&nbsp;<b><a><font color=\"#000000\">Bertrand</font></a></b>(1997, 38), also assesses that over two-thirds of the vertical border is here restored, and that the little that remains is so fragmented that it is possible that a piece might be missing from the beginning as well as the end of the textile. An examination of Montfaucon\u2019s engraving (<b><a><font color=\"#006633\">Facsimile: Montfaucon</font></a></b>, panel 1) might support this theory, as the left-hand border there appears less definitive than subsequent restorations have fashioned it.</p>", "created": "2020-07-28T22:42:15.394Z", "creator": {"id": "dnoneill", "name": "dnoneill"}}]}
