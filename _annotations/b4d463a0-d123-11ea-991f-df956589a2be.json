The two riders shown here are unarmed and unarmored; both are mustachioed, and both point their index fingers upwards. The upper and lower borders contain birds and lions, respectively.</p><p><u>Background:</u><br>This scene may be read as either a direct journey to Bosham or a digressive hunting trip on the way to the village. Both&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Gibbs-Smith</b></font></a>&nbsp;(1957, 163) and&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Grape</b></font></a>&nbsp;(1994, 92) argue that the unarmed depiction of the horsemen in this scene emphasizes the peaceful nature of Harold\u2019s impending trip to Normandy.&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>McNulty</b></font></a>&nbsp;(1989, 67) suggests that Harold\u2019s trip to Bosham is tangential, and, seen immediately after King Edward\u2019s orders, \"alerts the viewer to the weaknesses in Harold\u2019s character.\" As Bosham lay directly on Chichester harbor and was part of the Godwin family estate, it seems a likely candidate for the site of the earl\u2019s departure for Normandy. In all probability, this scene does underscore the diplomatic nature of&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#336600\"><b>Harold\u2019s Mission to Normandy</b></font></a>, as its details and form return in&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000080\"><b>panels</b></font></a>&nbsp;17-19, where Guy conducts Harold to William. In addition, the accouterments of the present episode, the hawks and collared dogs of the following panels, mark the aristocratic rank of Harold and visually reinforce his inscribed rank of \"Dux\" (see \"Inscriptions,\" below).</p><p><u>Details:</u><br>Early scholars, including&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Bruce</b></font></a>&nbsp;(1856, 30), read this scene as showing Harold twice, here pointing and again in&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000080\"><b>panel</b></font></a>&nbsp;4 with a hawk.&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Chambers</b></font></a>&nbsp;(1932, 27) believes that Harold here points up to his own name, most importantly, the \"x\" of DUX and argues that \"in Norman times x stood for property rights which it is possible the Tapestry was desired to extol.\"&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Fowke</b></font></a>&nbsp;(1898, 27) cites previous arguments that Harold is represented twice but concludes that the two figures here are only members of his retinue. Additionally, both figures here raise their index fingers, a convention which in many parts of the Tapestry indicates conversation.</p><p><u>Borders:</u><br><a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Terkla</b></font></a>&nbsp;(1995, 268) considers the zig-zag patterns on the border diagonals here and elsewhere to represent the Norman chevron and an indicator of \"Norman bias.\" He reads their presence as an ominous foreshadowing of Harold\u2019s Norman involvement.</p><p><u>Inscriptions:</u><br>Harold\u2019s title here has caused some discussion.&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Fowke</b></font></a>&nbsp;(1898, 27) argues that DUX does not convey a specific title, while&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Stenton</b></font></a>&nbsp;(1957, 11),&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Brown</b></font></a>(1977, 103),&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Lewis</b></font></a>&nbsp;(1999, 47), and&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Short</b></font></a>&nbsp;(2001, 279, n. 32) hold that DUX ANGLORUM was not an English title. To this end, Brown argues that titling Harold DUX here deliberately elevates the earl to a status equal to William (who is later depicted as NORMANNORUM DUCEM in&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000080\"><b>panel</b></font></a>&nbsp;32) in order to help establish the two as equal opponents. However, \"Dux\" appears to have been a common Latin title for Harold, and&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Loyn</b></font></a>&nbsp;(1966, 5) records that Harold was listed as DUX in Anglo-Saxon charters from 1045 onwards. Latin accounts of English earls, including Harold, commonly employ forms of \"dux,\" as a quick perusal of works such as the anonymous life of King Edward (<i>cf</i>.&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Barlow</b></font></a>&nbsp;(1992, 36, 48 and 76)) demonstrate. For Lewis (34, 46), this inscription shows that only after Harold leaves the immediate royal orbit does the earl acquire his own identity and status.</p><p><a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Short</b></font></a>&nbsp;(2001, 270-271) notes that the uncial \"d\" here and in&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000080\"><b>panel</b></font></a>&nbsp;9 is found nowhere else in the Tapestry.</p><p><u>Restorations:</u><br>This section of the Tapestry is among the most heavily damaged areas. A huge tear exists to the right of the horsemen, and some details may be missing. The front sections of both lions on the bottom border are modern, as are the front parts of most of the horses.&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Wilson</b></font></a>&nbsp;(1985, 174) notes that the middle letters of Harold\u2019s name have also been restored. By the 1729 engravings of Montfaucon, the first two letters of UBI had disappeared (see&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#006633\"><b>Facsimile: Montfaucon</b></font></a>, panel 2);&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Dawson</b></font></a>&nbsp;(1907, 256) notes that Montfaucon originally restored this mutilated word to RD, the last two letters of EDWARD, but that Stothard subsequently amended it to UBI in 1818 (see&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#006633\"><b>Facsimile: Stothard</b></font></a>, panel 2).&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000000\"><b>Digby</b></font></a>&nbsp;(1957, 55, n. 38a) extensively details the observations of Percy Hennell, the photographer of the 1957 edition. Hennell studied the rate of fading in later wools and concluded that the repairs in&nbsp;<a><font color=\"#000080\"><b>panels</b></font></a>&nbsp;2-3 are among the earliest performed and that early restorers used a wool similar to the original.
